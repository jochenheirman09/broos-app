// This file is currently not used, as all saving logic has been centralized
// in the `saveAssistantResponse` function within `src/services/firestore-service.ts`.
// It is kept for potential future use if more specific, isolated wellness-related
// server actions are needed.

// If you need to add a new function here, make sure to import `getFirebaseAdmin`
// and handle any server-side logic appropriately.
